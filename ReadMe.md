* Q4:  Does time series for Google Search Trend and Stock Price indicate a common trend that’s consistent between the search data and the company stock price?

      No, the trend between two time series is not consistent. After March 2020's decrease, closing prices were seen with rising trend during first half of 2020 with its peak in June 2020. In contrast, the search_trend seen a sharp decrease in March and reached to lowest point in April which kept fluctuating during May and June. However, the trend for this series is declining during first half of 2020.
      
      The volatility spiked, and tended to stay high, during the first half of 2020. This is a common characteristic of volatility in stock returns worldwide: high volatility days tend to be followed by yet more high volatility days. When it rains, it pours.
